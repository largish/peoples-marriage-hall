# peoples-marriage-hall

This is a voluntary project for the PeopleDAO (https://people-dao.com)

## Frontend

To test run, go to ./client in terminal
```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will spin up a localhost. 

## Smart Contract
The contract has been deployed to the Binance Smart Chain test net. Switch your MetaMask to BSC test net following this instruction: https://medium.com/spartanprotocol/how-to-connect-metamask-to-bsc-testnet-7d89c111ab2

Once the frontend is running locally and wallet connected to BSC test net, you can now test it. This will create a "marriage certificate" on chain.
